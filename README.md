Problem Satement
The rapid expansion of digital communication has made A2P (Application-to-Person) SMS messaging a vital channel for 
businesses to engage with their customers. These messages include transactional alerts, promotional offers, verification 
codes (OTPs), and other service notifications, providing convenience and enhancing customer experience. However, the 
proliferation of spam messages presents a significant challenge. Spam SMS often contains phishing links, fraudulent 
promotions, or malicious content, creating security risks, operational disruptions, and customer dissatisfaction.
Traditional spam filtering solutions predominantly rely on keyword-based or domain-based blocklists. While these methods 
can capture common spam patterns, they often result in false positives, where legitimate messages are incorrectly blocked. 
For example, a general rule that blocks all messages containing “.com” could inadvertently filter important messages from 
trusted domains like trip.com or prevent OTP messages from reaching users, impacting service reliability and customer trust.
The problem is further complicated by the ever-evolving nature of spam. Malicious actors continuously modify their 
messaging tactics to bypass static filters, rendering conventional systems inadequate for long-term protection. 
Consequently, there is an urgent need for an intelligent, adaptive, and scalable spam detection system that can address 
these challenges effectively.
The key objectives of the proposed solution include:
1. Accurate Classification: Automatically categorize A2P SMS messages as spam, transactional, or promotional to 
ensure legitimate messages reach their recipients without disruption.
2. Whitelist Integration: Implement a whitelist mechanism to recognize trusted domains, verified OTP formats, and 
safe sources, preventing the misclassification of legitimate messages.
3. Hybrid Filtering Approach: Combine rule-based methods with machine learning models to reduce both false 
positives and false negatives, delivering a reliable system suitable for telecom operators.
4. Adaptive Learning: Continuously update the system to detect and respond to new and evolving spam patterns, 
maintaining high performance and relevance over time.
This project addresses the critical limitations of existing messaging systems by leveraging artificial intelligence and machine 
learning to build an intelligent SMS spam filtering solution. By integrating automated classification with rule-based 
whitelisting, the system enhances both security and message delivery reliability, ensuring operational efficiency, 
safeguarding user trust, and improving overall communication quality.
Approaches
The AI-Powered Spam Filter for A2P SMS is designed to intelligently detect spam messages while ensuring that legitimate 
communications, such as OTPs, transactional alerts, and trusted promotional messages, are delivered reliably. The system 
uses a hybrid methodology, combining rule-based filtering with machine learning classification, to accurately categorize 
messages into spam, transactional, and promotional types.
Data Collection and Preprocessing
The project starts with data collection, compiling a diverse dataset of SMS messages. This dataset includes:
• Spam messages with phishing links, fraudulent offers, or malicious content.
• Legitimate transactional messages and promotional content from trusted sources.
Next, the dataset undergoes preprocessing to clean and normalize the text:
• Removal of duplicates, punctuation, irrelevant symbols, and emojis.
• Conversion to lowercase and tokenization of words.
• Elimination of stopwords.
• Feature extraction using TF-IDF vectorization to measure the importance of words. Advanced embedding methods 
like Word2Vec or GloVe can also be used for capturing semantic relationships between words.
Rule-Based Filtering
A rule-based system is applied as the first line of defense. Key components include:
• Whitelist Mechanism: Trusted domains, verified OTP templates, and transactional formats.
• Pattern-Based Rules: Regular expressions to detect suspicious URLs or repeated characters.
• This layer reduces the load on the machine learning model and helps prevent false positives for critical messages.
Machine Learning Classification
Messages not filtered by the rules are passed to a machine learning classifier, trained to differentiate between spam, 
transactional, and promotional messages. Models such as Multinomial Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest
are evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Techniques for handling class imbalance and 
hyperparameter tuning are applied to ensure optimal performance.
Deployment Approaches
Once the model is ready, it can be deployed using multiple approaches:

• Applied a whitelist mechanism for trusted domains, OTP templates, and verified transactional formats.
• Used pattern-based rules with regular expressions to detect suspicious URLs, repeated symbols, or known spam 
keywords.
• Reduced computational load on machine learning models and minimized false positives.
Applied machine learning classification to messages not filtered by rules:
• Evaluated models such as Multinomial Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or XGBoost.
• Split dataset into training and testing sets to ensure proper evaluation.
• Measured performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
• Optimized models using hyperparameter tuning and methods to handle class imbalance, such as oversampling or 
weighted loss functions.
Conducted post-processing to enhance reliability:

Machine Learning Findings
The machine learning component of the AI-Powered SMS Spam Filter plays a central role in accurately classifying SMS 
messages into spam, transactional, or promotional categories. After preprocessing and feature extraction using TF-IDF 
vectorization, several machine learning algorithms were trained and evaluated to identify the most effective model for this 
task. The models tested included Multinomial Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest Classifier, chosen for 
their proven effectiveness in text classification and handling of imbalanced datasets.
Among the models, Multinomial Naive Bayes emerged as the most effective, demonstrating superior performance on 
metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The model achieved an overall accuracy of approximately 97%, 
indicating that it correctly classified the vast majority of SMS messages. The high precision of 95% suggests that the model 
effectively minimized false positives, ensuring that legitimate messages were rarely misclassified as spam. Similarly, a recall 
of 93% indicates that most actual spam messages were successfully detected, demonstrating the system’s ability to capture 
malicious content reliably.
Detailed analysis of the findings revealed several key insights. Spam messages were generally characterized by the presence 
of promotional keywords, URLs, or numerical sequences, which the model was able to recognize effectively. In contrast, 
transactional messages, such as OTPs and account alerts, had consistent patterns in format and wording, enabling the model 
to distinguish them from spam. Promotional messages from trusted sources were sometimes similar to spam in terms of 
content but were often correctly classified due to contextual cues captured during training.
It was also observed that removing duplicate messages and performing thorough text preprocessing significantly improved 
model performance. By ensuring the dataset contained only unique messages and clean textual data, the model was better 
able to learn distinct patterns, reducing noise and improving generalization.
Another key observation was the effectiveness of TF-IDF feature extraction in capturing the importance of words relative to 
their frequency and distribution across messages. This method allowed the model to focus on words that were strong 
indicators of spam or legitimate content, thereby enhancing classification accuracy.
Overall, the machine learning findings demonstrate that a hybrid approach combining preprocessing, feature extraction, 
and a carefully selected classification algorithm can achieve highly reliable spam detection in A2P SMS systems. These results 
validate the methodology and provide confidence that the system can handle real-world SMS traffic effectively, minimizing 
false positives and ensuring smooth delivery of legitimate messages.

One key recommendation is to incorporate advanced deep learning models such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) 
networks, Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), or other transformer-based models. These 
models are capable of understanding the contextual and semantic meaning of SMS messages, which can significantly 
improve the detection of sophisticated spam that uses subtle linguistic cues or obfuscation techniques.
Another important enhancement is to expand multilingual support. A2P SMS messages are increasingly sent in regional 
languages or contain mixed-language content. Integrating multilingual natural language processing (NLP) models or 
training models on multilingual datasets would improve classification accuracy across diverse message types.
Continuous learning and adaptive model updates are also recommended. Implementing an automated feedback loop where 
misclassified messages are flagged and retrained into the model can ensure the system adapts to evolving spam patterns. 
This will reduce the dependency on manual rule updates and help maintain high detection accuracy over time.
Improving the whitelist and rule-based mechanisms is another area for enhancement. By dynamically updating whitelisted 
domains, OTP templates, and trusted sender patterns, the system can further minimize false positives while maintaining the 
effectiveness of the spam filter. Integration with external threat intelligence sources or real-time spam databases can also 
enhance the system’s ability to detect newly emerging spam sources.
From an operational perspective, optimizing infrastructure for scalability is recommended. Using cloud-based solutions or 
distributed processing can help handle high volumes of SMS traffic in real-time without compromising performance. Load 
balancing, batch processing, and parallel computation techniques can also improve system efficiency for enterprise-level 
deployments.
Finally, the system could benefit from analytics and reporting features that provide insights into spam trends, sender 
patterns, and message classification statistics. This would not only help telecom providers monitor system performance but 
also support strategic decision-making, regulatory compliance, and proactive measures against spam campaigns.
In conclusion, implementing these recommendations and future enhancements will ensure that the AI-Powered SMS Spam 
Filter remains accurate, adaptive, and scalable, providing long-term value to telecom providers by enhancing security, 
improving customer experience, and optimizing operational efficiency.
